== Description ==

Hoppening is a service which allows you to integrate city-specific concert or live events listings on your blog or web site. The service is specifically designed for music bloggers, venues, and festival websites.

On Hoppening.com, you can easily create concert listings using a friendly interface, which provides each site visitor complete artist information (artist websites, music videos, links to audiotracks etc).  Your widget is totally customizable,  with the option to select preferred colors, dimensions, style and placement on your site--inside a sidebar or directly in a page or post. The plugin works with the http://www.hoppening.com service.

The first step is to create an account on Hoppening.com in order to get your username in your Account Settings page. You can now create new concerts directly on Hoppening.com, or add concerts already created by others bloggers on the site, by clicking on the 'Clap' button.

Every concert that you create or you 'clap' will be immediately displayed in the now-integrated widget on your blog or site.
